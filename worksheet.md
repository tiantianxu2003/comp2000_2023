Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
  Ultimately, both platforms are reliable, and the choice between GitHub and Bitbucket will depend on the specific requirements and preferences of your development team or project. Some teams even use both platforms based on the nature of their projects and their collaboration needs.
  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
  api.py
  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
  test.js and out.txt
  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
  fitst: lib
  last: src tests ARCHITECTURE.md README.md pom.xml
  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?
lib 
# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints

Red vs. Blue
